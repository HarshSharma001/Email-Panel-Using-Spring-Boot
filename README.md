# Email-Panel-Using-Spring-Boot
This is just a duplication of my old project which was on Java Swing, and this I developed using Spring Boot. 

Advantage Of this version Of Email Panel:

1.) Code is quite flexible and readable. 
2.) Code has been developed as in terms of small-independent modules.
3.) This project has been developed using "Best Practices" of OOPS.
4.) Project is based on the latest and best Java framework.

Disadvantages of this version :

1.) It can't execute on any other web browser rather than Internet Explorer, because of restrictions and security reasons.
